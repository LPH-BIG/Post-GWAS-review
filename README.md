# Post-GWAS review

## Overview
This repository serves as a resource for a comprehensive summary of current post-genome-wide association studies (GWAS) analysis strategies, their applications, and integration with other omics data. The review article included in this repository covers key post-GWAS analysis methods and their implications for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits.
